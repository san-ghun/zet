# Zettelkasten Tonne for Park, Sanghun. (san-ghun)

> And, some high thoughts.

This is where I dump my thought with some knowledge as it happens, all my zettels ("slips" or notes) about almost anything and everything. The idea is rather simple, but also powerful. 
Warning: Just because something is here doesn't mean it is accurate, even if I still believe it.

## What is the Zettelkasten?

The **Zettelkasten** is a note-taking method developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann. It involves creating small, self-contained notes (zettels) that are interconnected through a system of references. This web of linked notes allows for organic structure, easy knowledge retrieval, and fosters creative thinking by combining ideas from different areas. It’s widely used for managing complex information and long-term projects. Digital tools like Obsidian and Roam Research have adapted the system for modern use.

## Please be aware.

A Zettelkasten is inherently unpolished and often contains information that may have been relevant, true, or written in a moment of passion at one point, but no longer reflects my current views or may be inaccurate. This is not a "blog," "website," or any form of publication. Failing to understand this when reading any Zettelkasten may lead to misunderstandings and potential harm. **Never** cite anything from this or any other Zettelkasten. Instead, use it to inspire your own research and draw your own conclusions.

**NOTICE:** This is not "open" content. Copying any material from this Zettelkasten for purposes outside of what is protected under American "fair use" copyright law is illegal. Violators will be prosecuted. This is to protect against misrepresentation of my current views or positions based on this content. I am serious about enforcing these terms and will take legal action if necessary.
