# What kind of things are in a Note?

Idea, thought, some knowledge? Is an idea or a thought can be a knowledge? Guess not every one of those. Some may can become a knowledge but most of them become trash and forgotten. What is a knowledge? 

1. facts, information, and skills acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.
2. awareness or familiarity gained by experience of a fact or situation.
