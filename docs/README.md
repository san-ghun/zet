Hi, I am Sanghun. This is my personal **Zettelkasten** Tonne page. It contains things on quite any subjects I want to write about. The latest additions and changes are [indexed]().

And here are two categories of zettel for my Tonne.
- [Zettels](/zettels) - for normal zettel
- [High Thoughts](/highthoughts) - some high thoughts (, or maybe those high thoughts)

A Zettelkasten is inherently unpolished and often contains information that may have been relevant, true, or written in a moment of passion at one point, but no longer reflects my current views or may be inaccurate. This is not a "blog," "website," or any form of publication. Failing to understand this when reading any Zettelkasten may lead to misunderstandings and potential harm. **Never** cite anything from this or any other Zettelkasten. Instead, use it to inspire your own research and draw your own conclusions.
