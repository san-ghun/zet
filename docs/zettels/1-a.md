# dexer

Having thought about the **dexer** to index `.md` files, I think it would be better to make a python script to execute the task. Also, **using only standard lib** would be better, not having external package to download, nor external dependency. 

And, it would be nice to **have dedicated config file**, format in `.yaml` or `.json`, if python support those in standard lib.
