# A markdown file list generator for Zettelkasten

I've thought about an idea that parse all the `.md` files in all directories and get the created datetime and title of the Zettel to make a index or a list with hyperlink to access, for Github page utilization. [^1]

1. choose dedicated directory or directories.
2. collect path of all `.md` files.
3. loop and get meta data of all files.
	- created datetime
	- title of content, h1 tag
	- tag?
4. use dedicated `index.md` file, if exist, if not make new.
5. write down and list all the file data into the index file.
	1. make hyperlink to the file in github page perspective.

For dev, **python** would be easy to start. The language is good fit to coding with AI and fast in implementation. Then, may convert and refactor to Golang, later.
