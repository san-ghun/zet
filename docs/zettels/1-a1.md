# How to get the `created datetime` ?

Using the obsidian api, I could only find how to get *modified* timestamp. But it is not what I really needed. So, I even thought about coding myself an extension to get those value.

To solve,
I used an obsidian extension called **Linter** to get the timestamp to fill `created` and `modified`. The extension has a configuration tab, and inside the YAML config tab, there is a toggle for the "date created" option.
